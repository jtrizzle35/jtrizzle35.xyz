				It was the evening of August 29, 2025. I was in Chicago laying on Tom and Christine's air mattress, unable to fall asleep 
				because Mariah Carey's song O.O.C. would not stop running through my head. That's when it hit me: I would build a website
				from scratch (composed entirely of dots, Seurat-style) that would broadcast to the world what song is stuck in my head each 
				night when I go to sleep. I texted Kevin "I wanna make a website." I texted Aaron "I wanna buy a website domain." 
				Neither of them really seemed to care.
				<br><br>
				Flash forward four days. I was home from my lil trip to Chicago. I texted Ben and Kristi (coders) explaining my vision to 
				them and asked if they thought I had it in me to create this website from scratch. Ben said "Yeah." Kristi said "Yaaaaa." 
				They proceeded to give me advice, using terms such as "Firebase" and "GitHub," both of which ended up playing a crucial 
				role in the construction of this website.
				<br><br>
				The next day, I purchased my domain, began teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and the rest is history...
				<br><br>
				I quickly realized that spending hours looking at a list of prior personal earworms can, in 
				fact, affect your future personal earworms. So I devised a self-imposed rule: on nights that 
				I work on this website, I am not allowed to add a song to the list. I quickly came to resent this rule, as sometimes 
				I would work on this website and the song stuck in my head come bedtime wasn't even on the list yet! So, 
				I ammended the rule to be the same thing except with the added caveat that if the song stuck in my head is one that hasn't 
				been on the list before, it can be added. Seems to be working well thus far, but I'll def keep y'all updated.
				<br><br>
				There are a couple things regarding all this that I'd like to make note of. Number one, a song being included on this 
				list does NOT necessarily mean that I believe it to be a good song. Rather, it is simply an incredibly sticky one, for 
				better or for worse. Number two, there are many nights where I go to bed and no song is stuck in my head. Get over it.
				Number three, I came to realize the font I chose for this site is anglocentric and unfortunately doesn't include diacritics.
				So when you see me omitting the acute accent from the i in Rosalia's name, you now know why.
				<br><br>
				As far as the future of this website, I've certainly got some ideas of things I'd like to add. If you'd like to receive an 
				email whenever (if ever) a new feature is added to the site, feel free to subscribe using the form 
				<a href="../ask_a_question">HERE.</a> But for now, sit back and enjoy my <a href="../stuck_in_my_head">live updated list of 
				songs stuck in my head at bedtime!</a> :)
