			<h2>about</h2>
			<p>
				It was the evening of August 29, 2025. I was in Chicago laying on Tom and Christine's air mattress, unable to fall asleep 
				because Mariah Carey's song O.O.C. would not stop running through my head. That's when it hit me: I would build a website 
				from scratch that would broadcast to the world what song is stuck in my head each night when I go to sleep. I texted Kevin
				"I wanna make a website." I texted Aaron "I wanna buy a website domain." Neither of them really seemed to care.
				<br><br>
				Flash forward four days. I was home from my lil trip to Chicago. I texted Ben and Kristi (coders) explaining my vision to 
				them and asked if they thought I could successfully create this website from scratch. Ben said "Yeah." Kristi said 
				"Yaaaaa." They proceeded to give me advice, using terms such as "Firebase" and "GitHub," both of which ended up playing a 
				crucial role in the construction of this website.
				<br><br>
				The next day, I purchased my domain, began teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and the rest is history...
				<br><br>
				I quickly realized not too far into working on this project that spending hours looking at a list of songs that have been 
				stuck in your head in the past can, in fact, affect the song that will be stuck in your head when you go to bed that night.
				So I decided that on nights when I work on this website, I will not add any song to the list.
				<br><br>
				It is also worth noting that a song being included on this list does not necessarily mean that I believe it to be a good 
				song. Rather, it is simply an incredibly sticky one, for better or for worse.
