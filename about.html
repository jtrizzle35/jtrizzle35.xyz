			<p>
				It was August 30, 2025. I was in Chicago laying on Tom and Christine's air mattress, unable to fall asleep because Mariah Carey's O.O.C. would not stop running through my head. And then it hit me: I would build a website from scratch that would broadcast to the world what song is stuck in my head each night when I go to sleep.
